The doors of the University's laboratories, libraries and lecture theatres were flung open in spectacular style by more than eighty academics at Researchers' Night held in September, part of Festival of the Mind.

Members of the public took in the visual delights of the Research Photography Competition. Photographs that tell the story of the research we do and the people who make it happen were on display for a public vote and the overall winner was Andrew Sole with his photograph, Tracing water flow beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet. Andrew also won first prize in the research in progress category.

He said: "I'm thrilled to have won. I went to see the exhibition myself, and the other entries were all of a very high standard. I suppose the beauty and unusual photo opportunities which crop up on a daily basis conducting fieldwork in somewhere like Greenland must lend a certain advantage!"

Andrew's image shows fluorescent dye and gas injected into meltwater flowing into a moulin (a vertical shaft linking the ice surface and bed) on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Water flowing along the base of the ice affects the speed at which the glacier flows. Examining the flow paths and speed of water at the ice bed enables a better understanding of the complex relationship between surface melt and ice flow and helps to improve predictions of the ice sheet's contribution to global sea level rise.
