			  <h1>A story</h1>
			  <p>I was a leader in an activity of the sheffield international college. in this activity what we need to do was to hang around in and outside the Sheffield and take photos in order to advert Sheffield and other cities, at the end we also need to make a post and give an introduction about what we had done to other students. At the beginning, nobody wanted to be the leader, maybe they were fear of taking the responsibility. So we played rock-paper-scissors and determine who should be the leader. Luckily I lost all rounds, so I became the leader. However, I did little things but commanded a lot, the members sometimes obeyed my command but sometimes not. Sometimes they gave me some advise and I chose from one of them. At the end, we made a post, but it looks very bad, because we hadn’t got much time left at the moment. Besides, several members insisted to do in their own way, they didn’t co-operate much. It was my blame as well, because as a leader I didn’t manage the time and rule them well. Luckily, the photos on the post looks good, because everybody come together and had taken a good position.
