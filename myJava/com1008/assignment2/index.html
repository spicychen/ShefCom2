			Selected following in depth market research, The Diamond not only reflects the physical attributes of the building with its distinctive diamond shape wrap, but also the quality of the space and facilities which will be on offer.
			Scheduled to open by September 2015, work is already well underway on the six-storey building which, as well as providing specialist engineering teaching facilities, will also house a range of lecture theatres, seminar rooms, open-plan learning spaces, library services and social spaces, including a café.

One of them states that Grove Street Families will soon be over, while the Balla in the black jacket expresses concern on whether or not they can trust one of the betraying members of Grove Street, worrying that it may be a trap. The other Balla member says that things change and money changes people.
			  <br> Big Smoke and Ryder. The next scene shows Grove Street members Big Smoke and Ryder talking in the kitchen of Ryder's house. Smoke tries to get Ryder on board while Ryder says that he needs to be in charge of his destiny. Smoke states that he has Ryder's back and that they have no choice and have nothing to feel bad about. Ryder accepts Smoke's offer.
			  <br> Mike Toreno and T-Bone Mendez. The next scene is in San Fierro which shows a man named Mendez brutally assaulting an unnamed gang member, which is stopped by another man named Toreno. Toreno tells Mendez that he has found a buyer down in Los Santos. Toreno then receives a phone call while Mendez continues to beat the unnamed gang member to death against a shipping container for snitching. Toreno tells Mendez that they need to be more productive and that he has a connection in Panama that can supply them with as much product as they need. Both men leave the scene as Mendez drags the body of the gang member away.
