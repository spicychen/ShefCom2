Description about my study
English: My English is good, able to talk to a native English normally. I know a lot of vocabulary in the field of computer science.
Math: Before the university, I got some general idea about the world. I am especially good at math, for which I have been keeping a good grade since I was in my primary school. In the Computer Science department, I study a lot about the logic, now I am very confident about this field.
Programming languages: Although I had never use java before I went to the university, in the 1st year, I had practice a lot of java. Being through some difficult assignment, for example, coding a robot and making it follow a certain path to the destination, making an app that deal with the data of weather read from a website and display it using the GUI. Now I have knowledge about Inheritance and Polymorphism of java class, jUnit testing, IOException, multithreading and etc. I also learned other languages such as Ruby, C++, PHP (and Html, CSS, JavaScript).
